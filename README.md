Group B: Paracancer vs. Cancer DeSeq

get-data bioinf-m2_group-project

ln -s /data/bioinf-m2_group-project/CancerAndParacancer.RData

You are given an RData file containing:
Expression matrix of patient samples that are:
Cancer or Paracancer samples (Group B)
Information about the samples
Information about the genes

You need to:
Identify the Differentially expressed genes between: 
cancer vs paracancer samples (Group B)
2. Show the top 15 genes in a table, and your DEG analysis using appropriate figures
3. Identify which KEGG and REACTOME pathways are up- or down-regulated in the groups being compared. Do this via a pathway enrichment analysis
4. Show us your results from 1 and 2! What genes are important? What pathways could you identify?
